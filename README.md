### What you can search for

We have created a search engine for the Weiland cohort! Search any name to see your friends' favourite foods and where you can try them too! If you try to search for someone not in the WEiland cohort, you can expect to see the following error in the console, 'This member does not exist in the Weiland cohort!'

### Features

- A search engine with a homepage, a logo, a search bar and two buttons.
- Upon pressing one button an API call should be executed and users should be shown a page with ten results.
- Upon pressing the other, users should be taken to the page of one of the results.

### Future Features

- Incorporate a Google Search API for names/anything that cannot be found in the local API
- Display a wider variety of potential restaurants when search results appear
- Improve CSS
